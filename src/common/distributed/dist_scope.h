/**
 * DistScope — scope-depth tracking and scope-owned reference management.
 *
 * A scope is a bracket around a group of submitted tasks.  Each task inside
 * a scope carries one extra "scope reference" (counted in fanout_total).  When
 * scope_end() is called, that reference is released for every task in the scope,
 * allowing tasks that have no downstream consumers to reach CONSUMED.
 *
 * Orch-owned: single-threaded, no locking required.
 *
 * Mirrors L2 scope_begin / scope_end semantics.
