/**
 * DistTensorMap — base_ptr → producer task slot mapping.
 *
 * At the distributed host level, every tensor is identified by its base pointer.
 * When a task produces an output, it registers the output's base_ptr here.
 * When a later task lists an input, lookup() finds the producer and creates a
 * fanin dependency edge.
 *
 * Unlike the L2 PTO2TensorMap, this implementation:
 *   - Uses std::unordered_map (no ring buffer entry pool)
 *   - Does not perform overlap detection (each base_ptr maps to one producer)
 *   - Cleans up entries actively when a task is CONSUMED
 *
 * Owned exclusively by the Orchestrator (main thread); no locking required.
